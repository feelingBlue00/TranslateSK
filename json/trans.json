  "This plugin allows final grades to be published back to a student information system (SIS).  When enabled, the user will be given an option in the gradebook to publish these grades.  This will occur via a POST request to the specified publish endpoint.  Each type defines its own content format and mime type.  The response from the endpoint does not matter and is currently ignored.\n\nFor example, the Instructure formatted CSV will POST a csv file with mime type 'text/csv' to the specified endpoint, containing the following columns: \n\n\"publisher_id\", \"publisher_sis_id\", \"course_id\", \"course_sis_id\", \"section_id\", \"section_sis_id\", \"student_id\", \"student_sis_id\", \"enrollment_id\", \"enrollment_status\", \"score\", \"grade\"\n\n(Note: the \"grade\" column is only returned if the course specifies a grading standard)\n\nFor each student in the course being published, there will be 1 or more rows in the published csv. Specifically, there will be 1 row for each login that the student has in the course's root account.  Most of the time this will result in 1 row per student, but if the student has multiple logins, there will be a row for each of them.\n\nIf \"Include final grade overrides\" is checked, and the feature for Final Grade Override is enabled, students with an override grade/score will receive that in place of the calculated score and grade.": "This plugin allows final grades to be published back to a student information system (SIS).
