Specifically, there will be 1 row for each login that the student has in the course's root account.  Most of the time this will result in 1 row per student, but if the student has multiple logins, there will be a row for each of them.\n\nIf \"Include final grade overrides\" is checked, and the feature for Final Grade Override is enabled, students with an override grade/score will receive that in place of the calculated score and grade.",
